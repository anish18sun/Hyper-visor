This repository contains project Space invaders which is a game written in C++ using Qt library.

Space Invaders is a game written in C++ which presents a basic space environment in which a main player ship is launched from a launch pad upon the startup of the game. Enemy ships come from the top of the space screen and they are to be shot down by the main player without being hit by the enemy ships themselves. If the main ship is hit by the enemy ships then the game over module is initiated. Bullets can be fired using the space bar or the left mouse button. The main ship can be hovered in space using the mouse or the arrow keys.
